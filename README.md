Please locate the *Starter Notebook* in the *Core Data Pulls* folder, as it will pull all relevant data into memory (**~4M rows**) and provide you a preview of how the data sets are structured.

**One caveat:**

**You must manually download the zip files containing both parts of the *WHO Mortality* dataset and extract the .csv files to put in your working directory; they can be accessed using the following URLs.**

**Part 1 - https://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/Morticd10_part1.zip?ua=1**

**Part 2 - https://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/Morticd10_part2.zip?ua=1**

Relevant documentation pertaining to specific features of the data can be found in the *Documentation* folder.

If you want to test correlation with other factors, *UN Happiness Index* and *WHO Air Quality* data can be found in the *Correlative Factors* folder.
